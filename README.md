This is the code for my personal python project for CHEG 472

It is an app to rate a professor based on 5 criteria. There are two parts to the app:
1. The place where the student rates the professor
2. The place where a professor can see the students' feedback

For the current build of the app, there will only be one student's feedback, but it is designed to summarize the feedback from multiple students.
